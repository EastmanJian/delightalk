    <p>US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said North Korea must "earn its way back to the table" for negotiations
        between the two countries to restart.</p>

    </p>Mr Tillerson said Pyongyang had to carry out a "sustained cessation" of weapons testing before any talks.</p>

    </p>It is a U-turn from comments made earlier this week, when Mr Tillerson said the US was "ready to talk any time
        time North Korea would like to talk".</p>

    </p>That remark was swiftly contradicted by the White House.</p>

    </p>What missiles does North Korea have?  How North Korea could tip the balance
        North Korea has carried out repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests this year, in defiance of global
        condemnation and increasingly heavy international sanctions.</p>

    </p>Earlier this week Mr Tillerson said: "Let's just meet and let's talk about the weather if you want and talk
        about whether it's going to be a square table or a round table if that's what you're excited about.</p>

    </p>"Then we can begin to lay out a map, a road map, of what we might be willing to work towards."</p>

        There are reports that Mr Tillerson had planned to repeat his offer of talks without preconditions
        But his remarks, welcomed by China and Russia, were promptly greeted with a rebuttal from the White House and a
        reiteration that North Korea must admit to abandoning its nuclear weapons before talks resume.</p>

    </p>Within just a few hours press secretary Sarah Saunders released a statement to reporters saying Mr Trump's views
        "have not changed".</p>

    </p>"North Korea is acting in an unsafe way not only toward Japan, China, and South Korea, but the entire world,"
        she said.</p>
